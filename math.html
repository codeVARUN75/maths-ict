<h1><center>Algebraic Expressions</center></h1>
<p><font size="40">Variable-A variable can take various values. It is denoted by letters x, y, l, m, , etc. A constant has a fixed value. Algebraic expressions are formed by combining variables and constants through the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
<br>
<p>Like and Unlike Terms-
Terms having the same algebraic factors are called like terms while terms having different algebraic factors are called, unlike terms.</p>
<br>
<p>factors-The numbers or variables that are multiplied to form a term are called its factors. Example, 5xy is a term with factors 5, x and y. The factors cannot be further factorized.</p>
<br>
<p>Coefficient-Each term in an algebraic expression is separated by a + sign or J sign. ... When a term is made up of a constant multiplied by a variable or variables, that constant is called a coefficient. In the term 5x, the coefficient is 5.</p>
<br>
<p>Polynomial and its classification-An expression with only one term is called a monomial. ... An expression which has one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.</p>
